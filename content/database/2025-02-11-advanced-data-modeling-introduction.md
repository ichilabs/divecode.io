- Data analytics (Preparing and processing aggregated data into useful and meaningful information)
- Quantitative data (refers to numerical data) and Qualitative data (refers to non-numerical data)
- Nominal scale / ordinal scale / interval scale / ratio scale
- Data mining (detecting patterns in data) / Machine Learning (teaching a computer how to learn)
  - classification analysis / associate rule / clustering analysis / regression analysis
- Data visualization guidelines
  - Who's your audience? What information do they want? What chart best communicates the information?
- Tableau
  - Analyzing data with Tableau:
    - Download and launch Tableau
    - Load and prepare data
